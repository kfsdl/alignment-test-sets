i don't believe there are many people who while reading the results of an opinion poll which was conducted by Metro Media Transilvania polling centre , and which refers to the prime minister , are inclined to believe a thing it says .
i , for one , when I get in to one of these , I move on and tell to myself - here is how Dincu wants to measure Nastase up with a micrometre !
and then he tells us the correct result !
just like I cannot help having the same reaction when it comes to the opinion polls favouring Mircea Geoana .
the foreign minister 's popularity ratings have been going up lately without him doing a big deal in this respect .
i really do not care , like the kibitzer selling newspapers at a street stall would say , who pumps up his popularity ratings and why .
but as long as at the corner of the street in Neptun , Orastie and Afumati , half of the residents don't even know his name , I don't see why I should swallow a pill prepared to fit who knows what plans .
may they enjoy them themselves !
but it is not the " scientific " result of the surveys related to Mircea Geoana that I want to talk about right now , but Adrian Nastase 's reaction .
on Friday , during the videoconference with the prefects , Adrian Nastase boasted about the results of the survey run by Metro Media Transilvania , where he had just been measured up with the micrometre by his subordinate Vasile Dincu , and turned red just like a turkey when he found that , according to the survey conducted by CURS polling centre ( which I don't believe , no matter what ) , Mircea Geoana equalled him in point of credibility .
Adrian Nastase just couldn't help it and reacted like me and any other kibitzer when smelling a fabrication .
it 's just that the premier and the leader of the biggest party in Romania cannot afford acting either like a journalist or like a simple kibitzer when it comes to politics .
in his case , the outburst is a bad sign .
it 's even the proof that nerves are letting him down , that he loses his temper very easily , especially when he feels he 's being set up with unorthodox means ( although they have already become classical in Romania ) .
a party leader with Adrian Nastase 's pretensions cannot go as low as to readily accept the results of a survey related to him and which can be suspected of " brushing him up " and reject another one that helps his challenger from the shadow .
it seems to me we are dealing here with a sort of pride , with a rough way of reaction of a man whose position obliges us to expect more of him .
furthermore , Adrian Nastase 's outburst also shows us that his egomania is on the up .
the premier is no longer accepting response strategies as he lets his feelings , beliefs or fears free .
he has also come to create fear among the members of his team .
many ministers avoid being approached by the press fearing the premier might notice it and have a nervous reaction .
it seems too much to me and it is also groundless .
instead of dominating his cabinet by taking some major decisions , the premier is about to become the prisoner of some collateral information .
what does minister x , what he said , how he reacted at who knows what decision and so on ( in a minor scale and an atmosphere of cheap scheming ) .
a thing is simple , namely that Adrian Nastase has no serious challenger both in surveys and inside the party .
instead , he has got an availability for a certain kind of attitude and is surrounded by detail suppliers ( which would work better during women 's meetings and gossips ) , which virus his discourse , his conduct and even his decisions .
his nervous outburst towards CURS survey ( which couldn't trick too many people anyway ) is rather the sign of a weakness that the proof that he is a strong man , willing to look down on his opponents ' agitation .
" on humanitarian grounds " , president Ion Iliescu pardoned three officers who ordered soldiers to shoot at the crowd on Calea Lipovei street in Timisoara city .
back then , on December 17 , 1989 , seven people were killed and 40 got wounded in that place .
after Ceausescu 's fall , the officers , as well as many others , got arrested .
to a court ?
since even the sentences ruled by the Supreme Court of Justice cannot stand valid any more , it 's only God who can still help .
it 's just that God does not issue papers to confirm appeals have been made with Him , neither does He say when exactly He will give an answer to them .
the only Court of Appeal , the ultimate court that cannot be influenced even by the pardoning decree " on humanitarian grounds " signed by president Ion Iliescu , is the history of Romania .
one day ( if attempts to distort it haven't already been made ) it is history that will rule a final sentence !
when OTV private station went on air for the first time without having gone through all legal procedures , nobody said anything . Any other person would have been arrested under the Romanian legislation .
non - compliance with the law is reason for arrest in France , in Germany and in the USA , as well .
on the contrary , the station was passionately and absurdly supported by Adrian Paunescu , Sorin Rosca Stanescu ( ! ) , Emanoil Valeriu , president Ion Iliescu 's representative to the National Audiovisual Council ( CNA ) .
despite the aberrant broadcasts , the outflows of slime , chauvinism , attacks on the person , despite criticism against the station and the statements made by the Romanian Press Club , OTV went on broadcasting undisturbed .
for months on end , CNA acted as a powerless witness or turned a blind eye to the infringement on the code of professional ethics and the audiovisual law .
why would that happen ?
because the Romanian politicians would rush like sheep or calves to voice their opinions in a place that would often turn into a media cesspool .
Ion Iliescu took Dan Diaconescu along with him on one of his visits to the Middle East and gave him a long interview .
by doing that , the head of state became responsible for the presidential institution being dragged into the gutter and for granting legitimacy to the gutter .
through his gesture , the president vouched for a TV station that was already foul and that later would go way out of line hosting dirty attacks .
Adrian Nastase too , in his capacity as prime minister , did nothing but confer the station further legitimacy through his nocturnal over the phone statement .
nobody bothered to look in to rumours about Dan Diaconescu asking people who wanted to go on air to bribe him to get invited on his show .
not to mention the OTV regulars , such as Corneliu Vadim Tudor , Gigi Becali , Dumitru Dragomir , Traian Basescu , Adrian Paunescu , Theodor Stolojan , Radu F .
Alexandru , happy to go on air before or after criminals and dregs particularly hosted by OTV .
all of them got there in order to take advantage of the impact made not by their speeches ( often lame both in concept and wording ) , but by the scandals caused by the attacks on persons , the spicy disclosures and the outflow of filth .
those who backed Dan Diaconescu 's fake journalism project would later discover that the filth promoted by the station ended up rebounding upon them .
OTV gradually slipped under the control of Greater Romania Party and started to cause serious troubles to Ion Iliescu , Adrian Nastase and the ruling party PSD .
that is why the station has had its licence removed .
had the mudslinging been directed only to the opponents of the ruling power , then Dan Diaconescu would surely have been allowed to go on turning public discourse in to dirt .
OTV history is in fact the history of " Romania Mare " magazine .
it was set up to tarnish the adversaries of the then ruling power headed by the same Ion Iliescu and later it was allowed to exist out of fear of Vadim 's verbal reaction or because of complicity with him .
the decision made by CNA yesterday , however upset Vadim 's fans and the people fond of dirt may be , came after the public language , the civil conduct and some people had been dragged through the mud .
it 's a tardy decision , considering all the above - mentioned reasons , and those who supported OTV have a legal responsibility ( if they are CNA members ) or a political responsibility , if they are part of PSD or of the presidential institution .
as for those who , in this particular case , may claim a potential encroachment on the press freedom has been committed , we should remind them that not any spoken or written absurdity can be protected in the name of this essential democratic value .
law and professional deontology ( totally non - existent in OTV case ) are also necessary .
contrary to politicians who imagine that everything is allowed when it comes to them , the communique ; issued by the Romanian Press Club shows that the community of journalists and editors is once a gain sending out a signal as they dissociate themselves from the " everything is allowed " concept in newspapers and on TV stations .
life has turned damn complicated .
Pavalache is not Pavalache .
Dancu 's affirmation regarding obligatory specialized studies for journalists does not necessarily hide the minister 's wish to speak to some educated people .
as a matter of fact , they could " hamper " his various " communication strategies " .
Vasile Dancu launched the issue of degree in journalism because the topic is funny in its stupidity ( after all , why wouldn't he be deeply concerned about raising the politicians ' intellectual level ? )
only that this topic is meant to cause a small - scale rebellion .
for a short while , the pen and microphone servants will foam with rage .
they will go hysterical writing about such a wondrous figment of imagination .
it is only at the height of this hysteria that Dancu will boil with pleasure .
because he threw a bone to the dogs .
and the resulting show is exciting .
and at the same time , two or three complicated things are solved outside the law framework .
his role starts to be pretty apparent .
he uses smoke fireworks to launch debate issues .
he cheats or puts the watch dogs to sleep .
in consequence , things have grown more and more difficult to decipher .
for instance , what does the same Dancu mean when he tries to feed the Christian Democratic Peasant Party ( PNTCD ) more oat than it can swallow ?
if he says about the Christian Democrats that they are in a state of " ascending dynamics " , what should we infer from that ?
that PNTCD is getting smarter with every day that goes by ?
that it 's growing in one day as much as others in seven ?
it 's a matter of elementary logic to remember that no politician says good things about his opponents .
why then would the information minister do that ?
to mock at the Christian Democrats ?
or to really help them ?
and if he wanted to help them , why would he do that ?
there has to be something more to this story than meets the eye .
Adrian Nastase 's PSD , even since it didn't exist , hasn't shown any sign of political generosity towards its opponents .
why would they try to do that now , after the Christian Democrats , while in power , did their utmost to give a hard time to their current benefactor 's political bosses ?
you ' ll notice that Dancu 's generosity is not casual and for no reason .
there must be a catch to it .
come one , man , stop keeping us on hot bricks and tell us what this is all about .
the trouble is we couldn't be a little mouse hidden in the rooms where this political firework was devised .
rumours are going round the town that support for the Peasant Party was asked from the Christian Democratic Internationale .
possible .
and that it was provided in the form of a helping hand to solve the party 's legal disputes .
but the story is going on .
why ?
only for the sake of an external friendship ?
or out of some cynical reasoning according to which those who do not believe in Victor Ciorbea formula would have their way blocked if a helping hand was extended to the current Christian Democrats ?
couldn't it be that the analysis department headed by Vasile Dancu reached the conclusion that the party making comeback preparations is more dangerous than the one that stands at 3 - 3.5 % ?
couldn't it be that this worthy - of - Catavencu analysis of a party in difficulty is hiding the fear of a segment of the electorate who haven't yet found their " shepherd " ?
more complicated games are being launched and a fake agenda is shown to us that hides other agendas and different fabrications .
Prague will come , Prague will go , just wait to see what a turmoil will start .
and in order not to fall victims to the tricks schemed by Vasile Dancu , be so kind as to read twice and think thrice .
an action will always start in some way , will look weird and will take you where you least expect .
just try to think which the last ninepin is that has to be knocked over .
there 's been a lot of talk about this subject for some while .
the idea was launched by PSD ruling party and cautiously supported afterwards .
it was initially put forward as a test to see how the opponents , the presidential institution , the press and the public would react to it .
the opposition parties declared themselves against it .
both Theodor Stolojan and Traian Basescu said PSD should fulfil its term of office to get quite tarnished by failures and corruption and so enable the opposition parties to get a bigger slice in the political cake in 2004 .
the Greater Romania Party simulated indifference .
they said early elections didn't matter to them .
they could be called anytime , even at three o ' clock in the morning when cocks start singing and pigs in the sty turn on the other side making grunting sounds .
Ion Iliescu beat about the bush in his typical style .
by indirect rejection and by leaving himself a hole to creep out of in the event he might reconsider the matter following the summit in Copenhagen .
it is certain that the president is not happy with this option as it will complicate a lot his political future .
the press took a neutral stand .
in fact , it let politicians fight against one another and get entangled in their arguments .
consequently , the population , susceptible to the president 's opinions and also slow to accept new developments , said no .
an opinion poll ( I don't know how reliable it is ) shows that 70 % of Romanians are against early elections .
consequently , the discussion seems to be drawing to an end , without having been conducted in a more serious manner , without having led to true debates and without having taken in to account an elementary fact : Romania 's interest .
the invitation to join NATO extended in Prague , as well as the European Union enlargement preoccupation have taken Romania to a further stage .
Romania has to show important progress in all sectors , including legislation , institutional modernization , the fight against corruption , economic reforms and the consolidation of the justice system .
the question that has to be asked is the following : can PSD , after two years in governing , with a mammoth apparatus and accused of corruption , meet such goals ?
the answer to this question should also take in to account the fact that there are only two years left to meet these goals , and these years are marked by the forthcoming elections .
if since 2000 to the day the government hasn't been able to achieve more , can we still expect a boost in carrying reforms through ?
this is very unlikely to happen .
the government 's socialist - style approach so far has been slow , cautious and with plenty of words .
in the next years it would do nothing but beat about the bush and try to place itself in the favour of the population so as to get as good a score as possible in the elections in 2004 .
this option would keep Romania at the same staggered pace of an old short - sighted lady on her way to the West .
which means that in 2007 we ' ll be only some points better off as regards the GDP , the per capita revenue , the consolidation of the democratic institutions .
and nothing will be left to us but to wave our handkerchiefs and blow kisses to the European Union as we bid a tender farewell to it .
that is , to deliberately assume our lingering in the same area of economic , political and institutional mediocrity .
but the acceptance of such a situation implies the entire political class ' boundless cowardice .
after Prague and Copenhagen , Romania needs a different pace and a different approach of the important matters in our society .
and these targets can be met only through the early elections formula .
a fresh parliament and a fresh government to implement reforms .
some readers and many politicians will probably say that this is Adrian Nastase 's viewpoint and that this article does nothing but speak in favour of him .
it would be a pity because , in my opinion , the rejection of early elections is tantamount to sentencing Romania to mediocrity , if not to the long - term ruining of its chances to join the European Union .
those who reject the option of early elections , but bring accusations of corruption against the Adrian Nastase government can be given only one answer .
why do you want a rotten government to go on ruling the country ?
as I believe we have to deal with institutionalized corruption , I wonder why we should put up with this governmental corruption for another two years and not penalize it though our votes as soon as possible ?
why should Traian Basescu , whose ratings all opinion polls show are falling like a rock , shout himself hoarse till 2004 ?
wouldn't it be better for him to show Romanians all the corruption cases at Victoria Palace ( the seat of the government ) as of tomorrow ?
and Romanians , who are very much aware of the local barons ' and PSD clients ' abuses , why should they put up with these horrors for another two years and not penalize them as of tomorrow ?
just because Emil Constantinescu has no party ?
that 's his business !
that 's his business and we wish him good riddance .
Vadim ?
let 's get real !
that 's the last thing we need .
to take care of the clown so that he doesn't fly off the handle .
the early elections would bring another gain as well .
the Social Democratic Party would have to break up with its sour figures .
nobody would forgive them in elections if they were to run with the same clients on their slate .
that is , Vacaroiu , Mischie , Miki le Baksheesh , Adrian Paunescu , Iorgovan , Pruteanu , as well as those suspected of being likely to be exposed in the election campaign .
all of them will have to be left in the background .
otherwise , the voters will deal the party a heavy blow .
there 's an idea that has recurrently come up in nearly all discussions about early elections .
that the early elections could result in another four - year term of office easily won by PSD after only two years in office .
this is a matter open for discussion .
what they mean is that the early elections would result in nothing but the re - confirmation of the same corrupt clique .
this seems an indisputable truth .
but before calling early elections , there is this solution for Adrian Nastase and the PSD leadership to clean up the party of all the scums who have surfaced over the last two years , even if they used them , or were profitable or made substantial contributions to the party .
only then the idea that a fresh term of office is going to be used to carry on corruption will be impossible to be put forward as an argument against early elections .
early elections are a political priority .
it is only this way that Romania stands a real chance of integrating with the European Union .
the rejection of this option only because Ion Iliescu has problems with his political future , because the opposition is not ready to fight , because a government corrupt to the bone could win the elections once a gain means we ' ll go on lingering within the same old bounds .
obviously , this will be a failure , as far as the national interest is concerned .
early elections alone can put Romania back on a sound track .
Iulius Filip is not one of those stuck - up Romanians you can notice from afar .
as if he was wondering whether his shadow was disturbing anyone .
this short man with his straight nose and hands like tongs was behaving in the Palace of Justice like some student summoned to the headmaster 's office .
as the cameras swept the court room where Werner Sommerauer from Brasov town was being questioned in the lawsuit filed against him by Ristea Priboi , Iulius Filip reached out and grabbed a national flag propping it against the bench in front of him .
Iulius Filip did not participate in the workers 's upheaval in Brasov town .
in 1987 he was fresh out of jail trying to contact Doina Cornea to joint sign protest messages denouncing the situation in Romania .
so , Iulius Filip , from Cluj town , had not many reasons for coming to Bucharest a long with the workers from Brasov .
but still , why did he take Romania 's flag in to the court room and why was he carrying tens of kilograms of documents ?
it is only after Iulius Filip has opened his bag as spacious as a shelf in an archive department that you start to understand what this is all about .
in 1977 , the worker from Cluj made common cause with the workers from Valea Jiului coalfield who were on strike because his father was among those who had risen against Nicolae Ceausescu .
moreover , the young worker sent the dictator a poem entitled " Dream and hope " .
it 's easy to imagine that the naive literary work by the locksmith from Cluj town wasn't conveying the same message as the bootlicking poems written by Adrian Paunescu and Corneliu Vadim Tudor .
that 's why he was arrested .
this man with his cold , harsh , cast iron figure didn't bow to anybody .
on the contrary , he started to write messages to Lech Walesa 's " Solidarity " trade union and to Radio Free Europe .
Iulius Filip is one of the very few Romanians prosecuted over " propaganda against the socialist regime " .
he spent some years in prison , he was sent to perform forced labour in the Apuseni Mountains and was forced to leave the country .
he is not a man to be pushed aside as one may please .
it is only when you come in to contact with him that you realize you deal with a man made of hard rock .
and as his freedom and his fundamental rights had been damaged , Iulius Filip came back asking for justice to be done .
in 1977 , the locksmith from Cluj town came back from America and started digging .
the day had come for him to scour the Securitate archives for truth .
and once a gain , like an obsession , he asked for his rights to be observed .
" he had a hostile attitude and wrote various materials hostile to the socialist regime in our country " , says a collaboration plan in his Securitate file .
" after he was arrested and convicted , he was worked on over the time of his detention , and he proved to be a hopeless , recalcitrant element who had not given up on his ideas and viewpoints , which is why he was frequently subject to disciplinary punishment " , says the same plan devised by Securitate .
and if this Iulius Filip , an unassuming person and a man of high common sense , couldn't be bent by Nicolae Ceausescu 's Securitate even by 11 year jail sentences and other disciplinary punishments , how on earth can Ion Iliescu , Adrian Nastase and the other PSD big shots imagine that such a man can be stopped in his attempt to find out the truth about the way his life has been ruined ?
trying to answer this question , we come to one of the most important problems of the Romanian society .
and , whether we like it or not , of the party called PSD .
