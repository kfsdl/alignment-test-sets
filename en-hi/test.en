The Government proposes to change the law to introduce tougher controls on misdescriptions of services .
providing timely information
building knowledge and skills
Consumer education is a top priority .
The Government is working with a wide range of groups to develop training packages for adults and schoolchildren .
Promoting customer service
Good customer service is an integral part of any successful business strategy .
The Government wants to encourage good customer service in a number of ways .
developing effective codes of practice
Working with business ,  consumer groups and local authorities ,  the Government has drawn up core principles for effective codes of practice .
promoting good practice
The Government will help develop customer satisfaction indices ,  and encourage their inclusion in existing and future benchmarking schemes .
more help for business
The Government wants to know whether small businesses should be protected by current consumer law .
e - commerce
The Government is working with the Alliance of Electronic Business ,  the Consumers' Association and the OFT to set up a new body to accredit e - commerce codes ,  which will be identified by a digital  " hallmark "  .
Helping consumers to get redress
When a purchase goes wrong ,  consumers are entitled to quick and effective redress .
signposting sources of advice
The Government will help consumers get quick ,  accurate answers to their questions by promoting the development of a new consumer advice network and launching a pilot telephone helpline .
enforcing rights
The Government is taking steps to ensure that consumers and businesses going through the courts or other redress mechanisms get a simple ,  quick decision .
Neither party should incur heavy costs .
Modernising regulation
Consumer legislation is already well developed and needs little extension .
Risk ,  cost and alternative ways of achieving the desired result will always be considered before regulation .
However ,  the Government will legislate when new circumstances emerge for consumers that cannot be dealt with in other ways .
In financial services and food safety ,  new frameworks for regulation are being built in the form of the Financial Services Authority and the Food Standards Agency .
reducing burdens
The Government believes there is scope for removing a number of burdensome regulations without jeopardising consumer interests .
Among other things ,  the Government is looking at :
updating and simplifying the law on weights and measures
the current system of consumer credit licensing .
Securing compliance
The Government is determined that the public should be properly protected by the law and that the law should be effectively enforced .
dealing with the rogues
Existing law fails to deter the small number of  " rogue "  traders who continually disregard legislation aimed at protecting consumers .
The Government wants a much clearer targeting of the dishonest .
It plans :
a power for the courts to ban from trading for a period of time those traders with a history of disregarding their legal obligations
a power for the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry to make orders by secondary legislation specifying that certain practices which have been shown to be harmful should be made illegal .
The power to seek injunctions and banning orders will be made available to local authorities as well as the OFT .
a modern trading standards service
The Government wants to see the trading standards service in local government strengthened to meet the expectations of consumers and business .
The Government will :
develop clear performance measures which encourage local accountability
foster better training to provide more officers to enforce consumer protection law and ensure a high quality service across the country
encourage closer co - operation between local authorities .
widening the enforcement base
Consumers at the heart of Government
The Government wants consumers to have a powerful voice .
It also wants to see effective consumer representation .
The Government will ensure that :
A consumer advisory group will report directly to Ministers
the development of consumer policies is based on sound evidence by putting additional resources into research and polling consumers directly .
a stronger voice for consumers
The Government is giving the OFT new opportunities to develop its role as a consumer watchdog .
The Director General of Fair Trading will undertake a fundamental review of his consumer affairs functions in order to build a stronger OFT .
The National Consumer Council  ( NCC )  is well placed to speak for consumers on major issues .
The Government will help relaunch the NCC as a dynamic and even more effective force in UK consumer affairs .
Joining it all up
This will ensure :
an emphasis on the issues which really matter to consumers
a forward - looking approach ,  identifying problems at an early stage
greater consistency in analysis and the development of solutions
more cohesion between policy - making and enforcement organisations .
Next steps
The White Paper is the start of the process ,  not the end .
It will provide a solid basis for the development of consumer policy in the future .
It establishes a framework ,  based on in - depth research into consumers' needs ,  which will ensure that new issues are properly identified ,  researched and acted upon .
The Government will promote a joined - up approach both within and outside government .

School Attendance :  Information for Parents
Introduction
If you are a parent of  ( or are responsible for )  a child aged between 5 and 16 who is registered at school ,  this information explains your responsibilities for making sure he or she attends school regularly .
The Law
By law ,  all children of compulsory school age  ( between 5 and 16 )  must get a proper full - time education .
You are responsible for making sure this happens ,  either by registering the child at a school or by making other arrangements which provide an effective education .
Why must my child go to school regularly ?
Having a good education will help to give your child the best possible start in life .
If your child does not attend school regularly ,  he or she will not be able to keep up with the work .
So children who have not attended their school regularly have less chance of getting a good job .
